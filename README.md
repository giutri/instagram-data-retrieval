# instagram-data-retrieval
A test in publicly obtainable data retrieval from the Facebook Graph API for Instagram. Fork and extension of https://github.com/jstolpe/blog_code/tree/master/instagram_graph_api

Additionally tests the use of https://pypi.org/project/igramscraper/

NOTE: Code is provided as is. I do not personally condone the use of scraping software; hitting API rate limits will result in the connected 
account being suspended. If one intends to run an influencer campaign, they should rely on trusted third party marketing firms which offer such campaign services
on their own terms and conditions.
